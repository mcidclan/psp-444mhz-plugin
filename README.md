# Experimental 444mhz Overclock

## Description
This is an experimental project for technical/educational purposes only, intended for developers only. Stability is not guaranteed, use with caution.

## Usage
L_TRIGGER + R_TRIGGER + NOTE to switch between 333 and 444mhz.

Visual feedback: displays a red square on white background when overclocking to 444 MHz, and a white square on green background when reverting to 333 MHz.

## Compatibility

### 2000 and 3000
Tested on PSP 2000 and 3000. Reaching 444MHz, which appears to be a limit before instabilities.

### 1000
Unfortunately on 1000, the limit seems to already be reached at 370MHz, from which instabilities start to manifest.

### PSP Go
Not tested
