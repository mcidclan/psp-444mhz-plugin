## Description
This is an experimental project for technical purposes only, intended for developers and advanced users. Stability is not guaranteed, use with caution.

- Disable all previous versions or similar plugins
- Remove any existing overclocking >333MHz code from your application

### Controls
Press **L_TRIGGER + R_TRIGGER + NOTE** to toggle between 333MHz and 444MHz.

### Visual Feedback

- **444MHz (overclocked)**: Red square on white background

## Compatibility

### 2000 and 3000
Tested on PSP 2000 and 3000. Reaching 444MHz, which appears to be a limit before instabilities.

### 1000
Unfortunately on 1000, the limit seems to already be reached at 370MHz, from which instabilities start to manifest.

### PSP Street
Not tested

### PSP Go
