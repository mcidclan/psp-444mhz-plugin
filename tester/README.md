# Experimental PSP Overclock Stress Tester

This stress tester determines the maximum value, with a small margin, of the frequency supported by your PSP, and writes it to the `ms:/overconfig.txt` file.

## Usage

Copy the EBOOT and kcall.prx to the same folder in your `GAME` folder, then just run the program as any other homebrew. Press `Triangle` to start the process, and let the frequency increase until the device freezes and shuts down.  

Note: Keep in mind that it still needs improvement to get a more precise value.
